### Additional Notes

I recently added error handling for invalid city names and API failures. If the user enters an incorrect city name, a modal will display with an error message. Similarly, if there is an issue with fetching data from the API, an error modal will appear with a generic error message.

Please feel free to explore the app and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for further improvements.
